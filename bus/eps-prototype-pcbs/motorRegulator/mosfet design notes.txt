Vds max = 130 V (must be larger than Vout)
Ids max = 8 A
Rds max = 16.25 ohms
"In most applications, a logic level MOSFET can be used"

The critical parameters for selecting a MOSFET are:
1. Minimum threshold voltage, VTH(MIN)
2. On-resistance, RDS(ON)
3. Total gate charge, Qg
4. Reverse transfer capacitance, CRSS
5. Maximum drain to source voltage, VDS(MAX)

*The off-state voltage of the MOSFET is approximately equal to the output voltage*. Vds(max) must be greater
than the output voltage. The power losses in the MOSFET can be categorized into conduction losses and
switching losses
